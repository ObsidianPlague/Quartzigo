# Quartzigo
A fork of Quakespasm Spiked.

This was built for the open source video game, LibreQuake, however it is very broken and needs a bunch of fixes to be 100% usable and buildable.

Features:

-Removed DRM check

-The game now insults you for turning linear filtering on (however im not sure how well it works)
